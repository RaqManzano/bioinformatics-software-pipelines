title: "Automated Workflows"

General introduction to Workflow Management systems (Nextflow, Snakemake, others?) and then specifically focus on nf-core pipelines. 

- what are workflows management systems and why would I want to use them?
- what are some of the main documented workflows available?
- how to use nf-core pipelines?
- how to configure nextflow to use software package managers?

Should there be a section on Snakemake as well? https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/
