title: "Package Managers"
---

This section could cover common package managers: 

- Pip for Python packages
- CRAN and Bioconductor for R packages
- `apt` for Ubuntu-based distributions
- Conda/Mamba as a more general solution

Most of the time should be spent on _Conda_, but good to introduce the others as common package managers people might encounter.
